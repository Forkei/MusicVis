# Optional ML dependencies for enhanced audio analysis.
# Install with: pip install -r requirements-ml.txt
#
# These provide neural-network-based genre classification, vocal detection,
# valence/arousal estimation, and music structure analysis. Without these,
# the app falls back to heuristic analysis (works identically).
#
# Windows note for allin1:
#   allin1 requires NATTEN (neighborhood attention). Either:
#   - Set NATTEN_USE_FLEX=1 environment variable (uses Flex Attention backend), or
#   - Install a third-party NATTEN wheel from github.com/SHI-Labs/NATTEN/releases
